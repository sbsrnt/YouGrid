# YouGrid Privacy Policy

_Last updated: April 20, 2025_

Thank you for choosing YouGrid. We respect your privacy and are committed to being fully transparent about what (if any) data we collect and how we use it. This Privacy Policy applies to the YouGrid browser extension and accompanies our Chrome Web Store listing.

---

## 1. Information We Do **Not** Collect

YouGrid is designed to be as minimal and privacy‑respecting as possible. We **do not** collect, transmit, or store any personal data, including but not limited to:

- Your name, email address, or other user identifiers
- Browser history or page‑view data beyond what’s needed to apply your own layout preference
- Analytics, crash reports, or usage statistics

---

## 2. Local Storage Use

To remember your preferred number of YouTube grid columns (1–5), YouGrid uses your browser’s **local** (and optionally **sync**) storage:

- **What’s stored:** a single numeric value (`ytItemsPerRow`) representing your chosen columns.
- **Why it’s stored:** so that your preference persists across page loads and browser restarts.
- **Where it’s stored:** in your own browser; we never send this value to any servers.

---

## 3. Host Permission

YouGrid requests permission to run on `https://www.youtube.com/*` so that it can:

- Detect when you’re on a YouTube page that uses the grid layout
- Inject a small stylesheet override to apply your saved column count

No other sites are accessed, and no data from YouTube is collected or transmitted.

---

## 4. Third‑Party Services

YouGrid does **not** integrate with any third‑party analytics, advertising, or crash‑reporting services.

---

## 5. Security

- All code runs locally in your browser.
- We do not transmit any data to remote servers.
- YouGrid is open‑source under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. If we make any material changes, we will update the “_Last updated_” date at the top of this document. You are encouraged to review this page periodically.
